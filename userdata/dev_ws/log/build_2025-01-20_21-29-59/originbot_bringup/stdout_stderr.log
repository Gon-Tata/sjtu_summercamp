[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:29 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findjoy_linux.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "joy_linux", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "joy_linux" with
  any of the following names:

    joy_linuxConfig.cmake
    joy_linux-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "joy_linux" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "joy_linux_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "joy_linux" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
